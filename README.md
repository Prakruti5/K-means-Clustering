# K-means-Clustering
The K-means clustering technique is implemented in this exercise under guidance for two objectives:

· Gaining an intuitive understanding of K-means involves implementing the method step-by-step on a sample dataset. This will entail updating the centroids according to the mean of the data points allocated to each centroid and determining which centroids are closest to the data points.

· Image Compression: Next, you’ll utilize K-means to reduce the number of colors necessary to represent an image. This is accomplished by grouping the colors in the image into clusters and substituting the closest cluster centroid for the color of each pixel.
